# REST Client

The REST Client extension for VS Code allows you to send HTTP request and view the response in Visual Studio Code directly. These are seperate from the API tests in the `tests` folder.

1. Install the [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client).
2. Open a `.http` file.
3. Send a request by clicking the `Send Request` link above the request.

Default environment variables are already declared in the [VS Code Settings file](/.vscode/settings.json).

Refer to the [REST Client extension documentation](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient) for more information.
