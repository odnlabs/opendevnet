Welcome to Open Dev Net, a vibrant community of developers! We've crafted these community guidelines to ensure a positive and respectful environment for everyone. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with these guidelines, as they serve as the foundation for our community's behavior.

## Respect and Inclusivity

At Open Dev Net, respect and inclusivity are paramount. We encourage all members to interact with kindness, empathy, and respect, regardless of differences in background or perspective. Our goal is to foster an atmosphere where everyone feels genuinely welcome and appreciated.

We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, hate speech, or any form of discrimination, such as racism, sexism, or homophobia. These actions have no place here, and any violations will lead to immediate and appropriate actions to uphold our commitment to inclusivity.

## Relevance and Focus

Open Dev Net primarily serves as a platform for developers. We kindly request that you keep your contributions and discussions directly related to development and collaboration. While diverse conversations can be engaging, our primary focus is to create a community that revolves around development topics.

We understand the value of diverse discussions, but off-topic content may be removed to maintain the core focus of our community.

## Self-Promotion and Spam

We appreciate your enthusiasm to share your work and accomplishments. However, we also value balance. Excessive self-promotion and spamming can disrupt the community and overshadow the collaborative spirit.

To maintain a productive atmosphere, we encourage you to share your achievements and projects in moderation, allowing for an environment where everyone's contributions can shine.

## Privacy and Consent

Respecting the privacy and personal boundaries of other members is crucial. Please refrain from sharing personal information without explicit consent. By adhering to this principle, we safeguard the privacy and security of our community.

## Academic Honesty

Integrity and respect extend to the academic realm. Avoiding plagiarism is essential; always provide proper credit when you use or reference someone else's work. This practice fosters a culture of intellectual honesty and respect for one another.

## Reporting Concerns

Our commitment to maintaining a positive community extends to addressing issues swiftly. If you encounter concerns such as harassment or guideline violations, please report them to our moderators. Your reports are vital in helping us address and resolve any issues promptly to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all members.

Thank you for being a part of our community, and we appreciate your commitment to these principles. Enjoy your time on Open Dev Net, where we collaborate, learn, and innovate together!
