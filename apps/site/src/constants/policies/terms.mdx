title: Terms of Service
---

By using Open Dev Net you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted these terms. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using Open Dev Net.

## Disclaimer

You are strictly prohibited to use Open Dev Net for illegal purposes. We are doing our best to prevent these activities, while trying to provide the best user experience as possible. If you find people or communities using Open Dev Net against the Terms of Service or even for illegal activities, please send us an email to [slekupvimplyrataqq@protonmail.com](mailto:slekupvimplyrataqq@protonmail.com)

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use the Service.

## Proprietary Rights

We (Open Dev Net) own and retain all rights for public available data (including but not limited to templates). We grant you the permission to use this available data for your own needs, but strictly disallow any commercial use. You therefore shall not sell, license or otherwise commercialize the data except if the permission was expressly granted to you.

## Availability

- Open Dev Net is provided as-is. There are no guarantees that it will be available in the future, and its purpose or availability may be changed at any time.
- User related data including backups may be deleted at any time.
- Any premium features are not guaranteed. They may change or be revoked at any time.
- Access to all or specific features of Open Dev Net may be revoked, for all or a specific user, at any time.

## Refund Policy

Refunds for payments may be issued when the user requests it and one of the following requirements is met:

- It's the first payment and the user requests a refund on the same day.
- It's a monthly recurring payment and the user requests a refund in a three day period.
- It's an annual recurring payment and the user requests a refund in a seven day period.
- A major premium feature was removed and the user bought the tier specifically because of that feature.

We still require a comprehensible explanation of the situation and never guarantee a refund. Partial refunds might be issued for annual payments under special circumstances. Refunds are never issued if you have broken our Terms of Service and therefore lost access to certain or all features.

## Contact us

If you have any questions or concerns about any of our Terms/Policies, feel free to contact us by email at [slekupvimplyrataqq@protonmail.com](mailto:slekupvimplyrataqq@protonmail.com)
