The `@odnlabs/api-client` package is essentially a class that provides methods to easily interact with the backend api. This package is used by the `site` and `web-client` applications.

## Usage

```ts
import { Client } from '@odnlabs/api-client';
import { ChannelType } from '@odnlabs/utils-server';

// Initialize a new instance of the client class
const client = new Client({
  version: 1,
});

// Authenticate the client with a username and password, if not already authenticated
// The client will request a refresh token, if one doesn't exist
// The client will request an access token, if one doesn't exist
client.login({
  username: 'slekup',
  password: 'GO3BWLT93HGPAY',
});

// All requests from this point will be authenticated with the access token

// Connect to the API via websocket
client.connect();

// Send a private message to a user
client.send({
  type: ChannelType.DirectMessage,
  to: friend.id,
  content: 'Hello friend!',
});

// Logout and finish the session
client.logout();
```
