# API Specs

## Technologies

#### Programming Language

**Rust** is the programming language of choice for our API, for it's performance, safety, ecosystem, and interoperability.

#### Framework

**Axum** is the backend framework we use. Considering it's backed by tokio, we trust it as a reliable and well-maintained framework to use in our ecosystem.

#### Database

**MongoDB** is the database we choose to use, as it provides flexibility, it's document oriented, and scalable. Flexibility is important because we won't be 100% sure of the database models we want to use at the beginning.

## Protocols

#### REST

REST is the main protocol we use for our API. It's used for all the CRUD operations, and for the majority of the API.

JSON is the main format used for the REST API.

#### WebSocket

WebSocket is used for live connections, such as live chat, live notifications, and live updates.
