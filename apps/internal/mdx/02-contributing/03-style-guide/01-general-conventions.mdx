All workspaces should follow the conventions outlined in this document.

## Commit Messages

Commit messages should be written in the present tense, and should be short and descriptive.

The workspace uses [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce a consistent commit message format. Commit messages should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Husky will automatically lint your commit messages when you run `git commit`. A GitHub Action will also lint your commit messages when you push to GitHub.

**Example commit messages:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
git commit -m "fix(api): fix bug"
git commit -m "docs(internal): update documentation"
```

## Naming Conventions

### Branch Names

Branch names should be written in `kebab-case`. For example, `my-branch-name`.

### Folder Names

Folder names should be written in `kebab-case`. For example, `my-folder-name`.

### File Names

File names should be written in `kebab-case`. For example, `my-file-name.ts`.

## Language-specific Conventions

Since the workspace contains multiple languages, each language has its own set of conventions that can override the general conventions. See the following pages for language-specific conventions:
