| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                                                                           | As the monorepo tool is NX and pnpm is our chosen node package manager, you will need it installed. It is also required for frontend development.                                                 |
| [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)                                     | Cargo is required for backend development.                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) | To run Postgres and Redis without installing them manually, docker can run images for these for development, but it is option. However, to run everything in production smoothly, it is required. |

## Installation

To install all node packages in the monorepo, run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

This will recursively install all the packages for the apps and libraries, as well as at root.

To install api libraries:

```bash
pnpm run install:api
```

## Execution

You can find all of the npm scripts <Link href="/contributing/contributing#npm-scripts">here</Link>.

However, to run the applications in production, we use docker compose.

In the root directory, there is a `run.sh` file.

This can be used with the following options:

```bash
./run.sh [prod|dev] [update|restart|start|stop|logs]
```

> If you don't have the correct perms to run it, you might need to run this first: `chmod +x run.sh`.

## Environment Variables

In the root of the workspace, there is a `.env.example` file. This contains all of the environment variables that are required for the applications to run.

Development commands require that all of the environment variables are provided in a `.env.local` file in the root of the workspace. Production commands, such as `build`, require that all of the environment variables are provided in a `.env.production` file in the root of the workspace.
