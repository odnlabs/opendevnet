## Tools

| Tool and Installation Link | Do you need it? |
| - | - |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) | As the monorepo tool is NX and pnpm is our chosen node package manager, you will need it installed. It is also required for frontend development. |
| [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) | Cargo is required for backend development. |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) | To run Postgres and Redis without installing them manually, docker can run images for these for development, but it is option. However, to run everything in production smoothly, it is required. |


## Installation
To install all node packages in the monorepo, run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

This will recursively install all the packages for the apps and libraries, as well as at root.

To install api libraries:
```bash
pnpm run install:api
```
