This document describes the specifications for both the website and web client. The website is the public facing website that is used to promote the Open Dev Net project. The web client is the web clientlication that is used to interact with the Open Dev Net platform.

## Technologies

There are several technologies that will be used to build the web client, each of which are recommended for developers to have solid experience with before contributing to **relevant** parts of the project, These include:

- TypeScript – Programming language.
- Next.js – Primary frontend framework.
- Redux – State management.
- TailwindCSS – CSS framework for styling.
- UI library – ODN UI.
- Docker – Create a containerized environment for the web client to run in.
- Git/GitHub – Version control and project code management.

Other technologies include JSON to interact with the backend API, JWT for authentication, and WebSocket for live connections.

## UI Design

UI designs and UX flows are available on Figma. The designs are publically available for viewing and commenting, but only contributors can edit the designs.

An internal UI library (odn-ui) is used for consistent styling and components across the web client. The UI library is built using TailwindCSS and React.
