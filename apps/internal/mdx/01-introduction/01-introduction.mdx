Welcome to the Internal Docs for Open Dev Net! This is a collection of documents that are intended to help contributors or anyone interestered in the project to understand how the platform works and how to contribute to it.

If you don't know what Open Dev Net is, here's a quick introduction:
ODN, short for Open Dev Net, is an open-source, privacy-oriented, secure and trustworthy platform for developers to collaborate on. It's a platform that is built by developers, for developers.

## Technical Overview

Here is a diagram of the architecture of the platform's services:

This is bound to change as the platform grows and more services are added.

## Looking Ahead

Open Dev Net has several goals that it wants to achieve:

1. **Community**.
   One of our goals to build a community of developers to help build and improve the platform.
2. **Open-source**.
   Currently, other social platforms already exist that developers use. Open Dev Net aims to provide an open-source alternative to those platforms.
3. **Privacy-oriented**.
   Open Dev Net respects your privacy, being open-source allows anyone to audit the platform and validate that it's respectful of user's privacy, secrutiy, and is overall a trustworthy platform.
