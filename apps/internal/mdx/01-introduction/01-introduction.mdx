Welcome to the ODN Internal Docs! This is a collection of documents that are intended to help you get started with Open Dev Net and to help you understand how it works. And, if you're interesting, show you how you can start contributing to the project.

## What is ODN?

If you're reading this, there is a good chance you already know what ODN is. ODN, short for Open Dev Net, is an open-source, privacy-oriented, secure and trustworthy platform for developers to collaborate on. As the platform is specifically tailored for developers, it consists of features not supported by other social platforms, such as streamlining workflows and allowing for custom developer integrations.

## Goals

Open Dev Net has several goals that it wants to achieve:

#### Community

One of our goals to build a community of developers to help build and improve the platform.

#### Open-source

Currently, other social platforms already exist that developers use. Open Dev Net aims to provide an open-source alternative to those platforms.

#### Privacy-oriented

Open Dev Net respects your privacy, being open-source allows anyone to audit the platform and validate that it's respectful of user's privacy, secrutiy, and is overall a trustworthy platform.
