| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                                                                           | As the monorepo tool is NX and pnpm is our chosen node package manager, you will need it installed. It is also required for frontend development.                                                 |
| [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)                                     | Cargo is required for backend development.                                                                                                                                                        |
| [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) | To run Postgres and Redis without installing them manually, docker can run images for these for development, but it is option. However, to run everything in production smoothly, it is required. |

## Installation

To install all node packages in the monorepo, run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

This will recursively install all the packages for the apps and libraries, as well as at root.

To install api libraries:

```bash
pnpm run install:api
```

## Execution

You can find all of the npm scripts <Link href="/contributing/contributing#npm-scripts">here</Link>.

In the root directory, there is a `run.sh` file.

This can be used with the following options:

```bash
./run.sh [prod | dev] [update | restart | start | stop | logs]
```

> If you don't have the correct perms to run it, you may need to run `chmod +x run.sh`.

## Environment Variables

In the root of the workspace, there is a `.env.example` file. This contains all of the environment variables that are required for the applications to run.

Development commands require that all of the environment variables are provided in a `.env.local` file in the root of the workspace. Production commands, such as `build`, require that all of the environment variables are provided in a `.env.production` file in the root of the workspace.

## Production

Currently, the production applications have not been tested in production environments, besides the main server, so there is no guarantee that they will work as expected. However, here are some notes on how to run them.

### NGINX

An `nginx.conf` file should be placed in `/docker/production/`. This will be used to configure the NGINX server.

There is an [example file](https://github.com/odnlabs/opendevnet/blob/main/docker/production/example.nginx.conf) in the same directory, which can be used as a template.

> Replace `0.0.0.0` with the IP address of the server and `example.com` with the domain name or IP address of the server.

### SSL Certificates

#### Cloudflare Origin Certificates

The docker compose file is configured to use Cloudflare origin certificates. To use this, you will need to create a certificate on Cloudflare and download the certificate and key files. These files should be placed in the `/docker/ssl/` directory.

#### Certbot

To enable HTTPS, you can use certbot to register an SSL certificate. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have a domain name pointing to the server (`A`/`AAAA` records).
2. Install certbot. For example, on ubuntu: `sudo apt install certbot`.
3. Run the certbot command with `sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d <domain>`. This will generate the certificate and key files in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/`.
4. In the `docker/production/docker-compose.yaml` file, replace the **nginx ssl** volume with the following:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/fullchain.pem:/etc/ssl/example.crt:ro
     - /etc/letsencrypt/live/<domain>/privkey.pem:/etc/ssl/example.key:ro
   ```
5. Restart the nginx container with `./run.sh prod restart nginx`.
